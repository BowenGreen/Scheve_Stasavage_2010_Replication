# Scheve & Stasavage (2010) Replication

Replication files for Kenneth Scheve and David Stasavage's (2010), "The Conscription of Wealth: Mass Warfare and the Demand for Progressive Taxation," International Organization 64(4): 529–61.

Overview: This is a reproduction of the paper's main results that I conducted for one of my advanced linear models classes in graduate school. Scheve and Stasavage’s (2010) paper, The Conscription of Wealth: Mass Warfare and the Demand for Progressive Taxation, argued that “mobilization for mass warfare led to demands for increased taxation of the wealthy to more fairly distribute the burden for the war effort” (Scheve & Stasavage, 2010). I replicate the main findings of Scheve and Stasavage (2010), being, Table (1) and Table (3). I find that the arguments of Scheve and Stasavage (2010) hold up well under reproduction, with the authors correctly estimating the influences of war mobilization on taxation, and their findings robust to alternative specifications. There are a large number of null values in their data which should be taken into consideration when interpreting results.
